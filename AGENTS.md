# Repository Guidelines

## Agent-Specific Instructions

- Before modifying any code, you **must** fully read and understand `docs/engineering_guide.md` and this file for the current session.
- Do not apply patches or refactors until you have internalized the expectations in `docs/engineering_guide.md` (architecture, style, and constraints).
- Prefer surgical edits that preserve existing behavior unless the user explicitly opts into breaking changes.
