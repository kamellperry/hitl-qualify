You've been invited to the debut of the HARDTOKILL Sales Tournament.\n\nIt's the first national virtual bracket where business athletes from across the country compete for a featured spotlight in Inc. Magazine and a chance to win $20,000 (I usually hate getting DMs like this too lol- so no pressure, no gimmicks).\n\nA group of industry leaders apart of the fortune 5000 brought me on to help pull together top talent in sales, and also people with some Instagram Influence. (My name's Israel, by the way - I've spent the last 2.5 years running an insurance and branding agency.) With your IG presence, I feel like you would be a solid fit.\n\nYour spot's open for 7 days - just let me know if you're down or want more info and I'll try to lock you in."

Magazine.\n\nBtw, I'm Israel. For the last 2.5 years I've run an insurance + branding agency, and a few Fortune 5000 mentors asked me to scout athletes like you who also have real motion on IG. Your account really stood out to me.\n\nZero gimmicks, zero pressure (I hate spammy DMs too). Your seat's open for 7 days; if you want the 2-min rundown, just reply “INFO” and I'll lock you in.\n\nEither way, keep crushing it.\n\n— Iz"
